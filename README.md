# DataCleaningThroughCentralTendency

As In my previous repository, you can able to see the process of data cleaning is through deletion of the rows and columns...

But, In this Data Cleaning project, cleaning is done by the help of the measurnment of central tendency(i.e Mean, Median and Mode)...

Every null values (i.e impurities) in the dataset is replaced by the values of the mean/ median based on the several conditions of the dataset.
